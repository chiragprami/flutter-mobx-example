###Core Concepts
The Triad of MobX, consisting of Observable, Actions and Reactions
At the heart of MobX are three important concepts: Observables, Actions and Reactions.

###Observables
Observables represent the reactive-state of your application. They can be simple scalars to complex object trees. By defining the state of the application as a tree of observables, you can expose a reactive-state-tree that the UI (or other observers in the app) consume.
